# Git Basics

## Introduction
Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's changes. It helps track changes, revert to previous stages, and collaborate efficiently.

## Key Concepts

### Repository
A repository (or repo) is a directory that contains your project files and the entire history of their changes.

### Commit
A commit is a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique ID and includes a message describing the changes.

### Branch
A branch is a separate line of development. The default branch in Git is called `main` (or `master` in older versions).

### Merge
Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another.

### Clone
Cloning is the process of creating a copy of an existing repository.

### Pull
Pulling is the process of fetching changes from a remote repository and merging them into your local repository.

### Push
Pushing is the process of sending your local changes to a remote repository.

## Basic Commands

### git init
Initializes a new Git repository.
